1) What was your first contribution to Ubuntu? When did you start contributing to Ubuntu? How long have you been associated with Ubuntu?

I joined the Ubuntu Desktop team in February 2009.  My first contribution was patching applications that used "actions" in notifications to remove the actions to support our new notify-osd which was included in Jaunty.

2) You describe yourself as an Integration Engineer. What all roles does an Integration Engineer account for?  

My title was Integration Engineer back when I first started at Canonical, where my focus was integration work to make many open source applications work well with our vision of the Ubuntu Desktop. My current title is actually Software Engineer, working on the Systems Apps team.
 
3) Do you have a formal education in Computer Science or related fields? Or are you a self taught programmer? When did you first start programming/developing? What language(s) and machine was it?

Sort of, I spent 6 years in the US Air Force where I gained my first professional programming experience while I was also attending college part time.  I was actually a business major, but I did take some programming classes.  I am mostly self taught.  As a kid I always had to know how things worked, so I would take apart my toys to figure them out then build them again.  I learned some BASIC during a summer camp after 5th grade, then shortly after I got my first computer which was a Commodore 64.  I was 19 when I got my first 386 PC, which of course I had to take it apart to learn how it worked.  Windows wasn't really friendly for a tinkerer like me, so it wasn't long before I switched to Slackware Linux (1993, so long before Ubuntu).
 
4) How is Ubuntu Phone's convergence different than what Microsoft is doing with continuum? When can we expect a public release?

I'm not all that familiar with continuum, but the little I've seen it looks pretty similar to our work.  It's hard to answer the question about the public release date.  We're actively working on features related to convergence, which we are landing as they are complete.  You can experience what we've done so far if you have a device capable of attaching an external display, like an Nexus 7 or Nexus 4.  Release date for a device with our full convergence vision depends mostly on the hardware vendors.

5) Can developers develop their own scopes just like they can make apps for the phone? What is the ideology behind scopes and how are they supposed to be different than regular apps?

Sure, our API makes it easy to write scopes in C++ and even JavaScript.  There are a number of differences in creating a scope compared to an application, for example creating a scope doesn't require developing your own user interface.  You simply expose the content from the scope and the unity8 shell provides the view.  
 
6) Approximately how many people are there behind the Ubuntu Phone project currently? 

That's a really tough question to answer, within Canonical we have a number of teams working together to create the phone.  We also have an amazing community of developers also contributing to the phone, it's nearly impossible to really put a number on it.
